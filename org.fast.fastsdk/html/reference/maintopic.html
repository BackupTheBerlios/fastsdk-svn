<h1>FAST Syntax</h1>
Here is a BNF-like grammar for FAST input scripts:
<br />
program : statements
<br />
;
<br />
statements : statement | statements
<br />
;
<br />
statement : node "=&gt;" node
<br />
;
<br />
node: "entry" | "exit" | predicate_node | function_node
<br />
;
<br />
predicate_node : "&lt;" node_name ">"
<br />
;
<br />
node_name : node_label | node_id ":" node_label
<br />
;
<br />
node_label : /.+/ ; node_id : /\d+/
<br />
;
<br />
function_node : "[" node_name "]"
<br />
;
<br />
Note that every /.../ in the grammar is a Perl regexp. To be honest, the
definition of node_label is a bit fuzzy. The following string are all
valid node_labels:
<br />
"a &gt; b"
<br />
"53 &lt; a+5"
<br />
"aaaa bbbb &lt;&gt; dsd"
<br />
So the grammar given above can not be implemented by a shift/reduce
parser.
<br />
<br />
It should be mentioned that whitespaces are not taken into account in
the preceding grammar. The FAST input language is based on lines. Every
statement should be placed in a single line (empty lines are okay).
Whitespaces are okay between terminals and nonterminals. They'll be
ignored silently outside node_names, but will be preserved within
node_names.
<br />
Last but not least, the FAST input language is case-sensitive.
